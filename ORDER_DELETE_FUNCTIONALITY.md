# Order Delete Functionality Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of order deletion functionality for admin users in the 360-Web application.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Order Controller (`backend/src/order/order.controller.ts`)

- Added `Delete` import from `@nestjs/common`
- Added new DELETE endpoint: `DELETE /api/orders/:id`
- Protected with `JwtAuthGuard` and `AdminGuard`
- Only admin users can access this endpoint
- Returns a success message when order is deleted

#### 2. Order Service (`backend/src/order/order.service.ts`)

- Added `deleteOrder(id: string)` method
- Validates that the order exists before deletion
- Deletes order items first (due to foreign key constraints)
- Deletes the order record
- Returns success message

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Admin Service (`frontend/src/app/service/admin/admin.service.ts`)

- Added `deleteOrder(orderId: string)` method
- Makes HTTP DELETE request to `/api/orders/:id`
- Includes authentication headers

#### 2. Admin Component (`frontend/src/app/admin/admin.ts`)

- Added `deleteOrder(orderId: string)` method
- Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- Displays success/error messages using toast service
- Reloads orders list after successful deletion

#### 3. Admin Template (`frontend/src/app/admin/admin.html`)

- Added delete button in the Actions column of the orders table
- Button has red color and trash icon
- Includes tooltip "Delete Order"
- Calls `deleteOrder(order.id)` on click

## Security Features

1. **Admin-Only Access**: Only users with admin role can delete orders
2. **Authentication Required**: JWT token must be valid
3. **Confirmation Dialog**: User must confirm deletion before proceeding
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages displayed to user

## API Endpoint

```
DELETE /api/orders/:id
```

**Headers:**

- `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>`

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Order deleted successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing JWT token
- `403 Forbidden`: User is not an admin
- `404 Not Found`: Order with specified ID doesn't exist

## Usage

1. Navigate to the Admin panel
2. Go to the "Orders" section
3. Find the order you want to delete
4. Click the red trash icon in the Actions column
5. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog
6. The order will be permanently deleted and removed from the list

## Database Impact

- Order items are deleted first (due to foreign key constraints)
- Order record is then deleted
- This is a permanent deletion - no soft delete implemented
- No impact on products, users, or other related data

## Testing

Both frontend and backend code compiles successfully without errors:

- Backend: `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅
- Frontend: `npx ng build --configuration development` ✅
